Backend:
--------

1) I have created an authentication flow by which only admins can fetch the list of the application. With the same flow we can create update/delete application flow.
- I have used middleware to authenticate the perticular user (Admin)
2) for the database, I have used mongodb. Please replace the DB url in the .env file.
3) 3 APIs in the backend code: Listing API (with authentication), login (for admin- which will give a token for authorization in the response), application submit (to fill the form and create an entry in the database)
4) Kindly follow the readme.md file to run the backend server.

- We can use bcrypt or crypto modules for password encryption. For now it is implemented in a normal way.
- To add the admin user data by seeder, we can simply create a script having a query to add a user using mongoose. Just run the script and user will be added in the database.

- Kindly create a user with any credentials in the database as the seeder file is not included.


Frontend:
---------

1) Vue3 is used to implement the UI.
2) A normal form has been created having some normal fields with validations
3) Kindly follow the readme.md file to run the vue frontend project
4) We can also place a logout button at the navigation menu.
